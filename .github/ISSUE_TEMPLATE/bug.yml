        When I finish the second mission, the game crashes.

        Here's a screenshot of the place and its placement on the map:

        Try to explain so someone else could do the same thing.  Upload savedata if possible to make it easier to reproduce.

        The mission should be passing without crashing.

        If it's a crash, just say "It shouldn't crash."  For more complex bugs, it helps to explain what should happen as it's not always obvious.

        ASI loader is capable of generating crash minidumps and crash logs. To use this feature, create a folder named CrashDumps in the folder with asi loader's dll (game root). Instructions how to locate game directory [here](https://cookieplmonster.github.io/setup-instructions/#locating-your-game-directory). (Note: On Steam version you have to create CrashDumps folder in GTAIV subdirectory.)
        In case of a hang/freeze, open task manager when the game is stuck, select process, and click "Create memory dump file". Upload it somewhere and post here. The file will be quite large.

        If it worked before, it's usually easier to narrow down a fix.

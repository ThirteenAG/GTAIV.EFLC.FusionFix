> Want to help release the next version of Fusion Fix? Past few months a lot of work was done by @Parallellines0451 and other contributors to bring volumetric fog feature to Fusion Fix, along with other things, and I (@ThirteenAG) am having troubles finishing my remaining tasks(due to some irl circumstances) to complete the next major build. I decided to start a crowdfunding campaign to help me make this release faster. The end goal of 1500$ would allow me to literally "drop everything" and focus on finishing up of what we started implementing in the beginning of 2025.
>
> Current changelog:
>- Added volumetric fog
>- Added radial depth of field
>- Added smoother light volumes
>- Added tone mapping
>- Fixed night shadow bias and restored console softness
>- Fixed water reflection offset
>- Fixed water artifacts visible from high altitudes
>- Adjusted corona view distance in paraboloid reflections
>- Improved "PC+" tree lighting
>- Improved sun shafts mask
>- Improved console gamma curve
>- Restored visualsettings rain.defaultlight functionality
>- Restored console rain density
>- Reduced procobj pop-in at higher settings
>- Added a PC style tree lod atlas
>- Added a timed events toggle
>- Fixed a crash in the TLAD benchmark sequence
>
> There might be other additions to this later, because it's unclear at the moment what's possible to implement (e.g. moving during sniper zoom).
>
> If there's no interest in helping me out, the release will still happen at some point, I just can't tell exactly when at the moment.

### Details

- **AimingZoomFix** - set to **1** for proper fix, so it behaves like on xbox, set to **2** to have this fixed feature enabled in IV and TLAD, set to **-1** to disable this feature. **0** disables the fix, as usual.

- **FpsLimit** - enter a desired value to specify the number of frames per second you want for the game. Like 30, 45, 60 or more. This will affect all gameplay.

- **CutsceneFpsLimit** - enter a desired value to specify the number of frames per second you want for the game to use on cutscenes only.

- **ScriptCutsceneFovLimit** - this is the minimum fov value the game can set during script cutscenes, [like this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NzKw7ijHG10&hd=1). It prevents the game to zoom in too much on high fps. Since it's not a proper fix for the issue, you may disable it and use _hidden_ setting **ScriptCutsceneFpsLimit** that works the same way as **CutsceneFpsLimit**.

- **DefaultCameraAngleInTLAD** - TLAD uses a different camera angle on bikes, this option can force the original IV camera angle. [Enabled](https://i.imgur.com/PqFHJfU.jpg) / [Disabled](https://i.imgur.com/5kM5Sgn.jpg)

- **PedDeathAnimFixFromTBOGT** - when you perform a counter attack after a dodge in IV & TLAD, the ped after falling and dying performs an additional death animation, which doesn't happen in TBOGT. [Enabled](https://imgur.com/EYsiGPe) / [Disabled](https://imgur.com/CR3LEdR)

- **DisableCameraCenteringInCover** - [see issue 20](https://github.com/GTAmodding/GTAIV-Issues-List/issues/20).

- **VehicleBudget** - allows to increase the budget of vehicles.

- **PedBudget** - allows to increase the budget of pedestrians.

- **LightSyncRGB** - custom ambient lighting for IV, TLAD and TBOGT, health indication on G-Keys, police lights, ammo counter.
